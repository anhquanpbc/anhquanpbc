### About me:

I began an internship in the IT Support department of a multinational technology corporation in 2020. Initially, my role was to assist users and ensure their systems and devices were functioning properly. However, as time passed, I found the repetitive tasks unfulfilling and began to feel discontent. This led me to explore scripting with batch and PowerShell to automate these processes. My journey continued as I delved into C#, JavaScript (React & Node), and other technologies to create management systems and automation tools for internal use within the company, which I thoroughly enjoyed. Although it may seem unconventional to combine IT Support with coding instead of pursuing a full-stack development path, I find it uniquely satisfying.
